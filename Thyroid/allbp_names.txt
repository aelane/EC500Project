Processing Steps (Annie Lane 11/18/15):
Replace question marks (unknown values) with NaN = Not a Number -- 4556 instances
Replace t for true with 1 -- 13,579 instances
Replace f for false with 0 -- 42,421 instances
Replace Genders with F = 1  -- 1830 instances
	and M = 2 --  860instances 
Replace .| between the class and the patient ID with a comma (easier to import)

other (6) = 1632

Class mapping	
negative = Class 0 -- 2667 instances
increased Binding protein = Class 1	-- 124 instances
decreased binding protein = Class 2 -- 9 instances



n = 2800 (number of samples)
